## Intended Audience

This tutorial is appropriate for students and faculty who want to learn the
basics of git, and a workflow for contributing to typical FOSS projects on
GitHub.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

A working knowledge of the command line would be helpful. You should be able
to get to a command prompt, issue commands, know how to get help on commands,
and be able to navigate a file system from the command line. There are many
free, online tutorials for the command line [1-3].

## Prerequisite Materials

Participants should bring a laptop with working wifi and pre-installed
installed with git such that it is available from the command line. For Windows
we recommend Git for Windows [1], which will give you a Linux-based environment
as well as all the tools you'll need. For Linux, git should be available
through your package manager. For OS X, consider first installing a package
manager, like Homebrew [2], then use it to install git. Also, participants
should also have a GitHub [3] account and should be prepared to log into that
account. For convenience, participants may also want to have ssh install and
available on the command line and configure for use with GitHub (cf. [4]).
