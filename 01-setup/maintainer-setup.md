# Maintainer's Setup

## A. Get organized

1. Assign the _maintainer_ role to one of your team members. They will carry out the actions described in this activity on behalf of the team.
2. Assign the _navigator_ role to one of your team members. They will have these instructions open on their computer, keep track of which step the _maintainer_ is on, read each instruction out loud, and help the _maintainer_ to complete the instructions.
3. Assign the _recorder_ role to one of your team members (if you have only two, give this role to the _navigator_). They will have the team's notepad open on their computer, take notes for the team in this pad as needed, help the _maintainer_ to complete the instructions.


## B. Create an organization

__Assumptions__

* You are signed into GitHub

__Instructions__

On GitHub (you must be signed-in)

1. Click the plus `+` in the upper right corner and select __New organization__.
2. Name it what you like.
3. Select a free plan.
4. Use the email associated with your GitHub account as the billing address. (Since you chose the free plan you won't get billed.)
5. Invite each of your team members to be an organization member.
6. Finish the creation of the organization.
7. Help your recorder to make a note of the URL of the organization's homepage.
8. Configure member privileges so that organization members can write to repositories. See __Settings__ >> __Member privileges__ >> __Repository permissions__ .

Congratulations! You have created an organization that can hold multiple repositories for your team. More importantly for this activity, this setup allows any of your team members to play the role of _maintainer_ or _contributor_ using a fork-pull-request based workflow (also known as [GitHub-flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow).

## C. Create a project repository

Assumptions

* You are signed into GitHub
* You have just created an organization
* You are on your newly created organization's home page
* Your organization is empty; i.e., it does not have any repositories

On GitHub (you must be signed-in)

1. Click the big green __Create a new repository__ button
2. Name the repository `ourfavorites`
3. Optionally add a description
4. Make it public
5. Initialize it with a README
6. Optionally add a .gitignore (not necessary for this activity)
7. Add an open source license (unless you have a strong opinion, for now choose __GNU Public License v3.0__)
8. What is the URL to your official upstream repository?
9. Click the big green __Create repository__ button
10. Help your recorder to make a note of the URL of the repository's homepage.

Congratulations! You have created your team's first repository.
