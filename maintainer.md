# Maintainers Guide

This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide as much as it is to point you in the right direction.

Your first stop should be [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).

## Create an organization

Organizations are useful when...

* You expect to have more than one related projects.
* You need to organize developers into teams and manage privileges to different projects.
* You want everyone, including the maintainer, to contribute to the project using a fork-pull-request workflow (as described in this project).

It's this last reason that we are discussing organizations in this document. Each account can have only a single copy of a project (fork or not). So if the maintainer were to create a project under their personal account, then the maintainer couldn't fork that project into their personal account. Now there is no reason a maintainer has to use a fork-pull-request workflow. But for consistency, we want contributor to follow the same workflow.

To create an organization on GitHub, follow GitHub's instructions for [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/).


## Create and configure a project

1. To create a project on GitHub, follow GitHub's instructions for [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/).

2. Configure your project under the __Settings__ tab.

3. Checkout your project's community profile under the __Insights__ tab and the __Community__ section. Try to add as many of the recommended documents as you can. Search for templates for these on-line (e.g., README template) to help get you started.
