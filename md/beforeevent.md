Download and install git, bash, and vim
---------------------------------------

The git activity assumes that you are using git from a bash shell, and git is
configured to use vi as its default editor. The instructions below will get you
a reasonable approximation of this configuration. If you know what you are doing
you may deviate from this configuration.

__Windows__: Download and install Git for Windows. This will give you a basic
Linux-like environment including bash, vim, and git. Stick to defaults unless
you have strong opinion otherwise, and you know what you are doing.

__OSX__: Bash is built into Terminal.app. To install vim and git, first
install homebrew and then use homebrew to install vim and git:

    $ brew install vim git

__Linux__: Most popular Linux distributions default to bash. Install vim and git
using your package manager:

    $ sudo apt-get install git
