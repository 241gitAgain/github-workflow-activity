## Getting Started

Instructor:

0. Before the session, print copies of activity.md and guide.md, 1 per team.
1. (10 min) Go through the presentation ___quickly___ to give students an overview of the workflow they'll be experiencing. Be sure to manage expectations; students will not be able to learn everything from the presentation. The goal is to just get a working understanding. Let them know that there is an activity and a guide that will walk them through each step, and that the slides are available on-line.
  - Form teams (on appropriate slide)
  - Hand out one copy of activity.md and guide.md to each team (on appropriate slide)
  - Leave penultimate slide up while students work through activity
2. (70 min) Participants work through activities, circulate ensuring that participants understand what they are doing, keeping teams moving and working together.
