# Create an organization and a repository

## Create an organization

__Assumptions__

* You are signed into GitHub.

__Instructions__

On GitHub (you must be signed-in)

1. Click the plus `+` in the upper right corner and select __New organization__.
2. Name it what you like.
3. Use the email associated with your GitHub account as the billing address. (Since you chose the free plan you won't get billed.)
4. Select a free plan.
5. Finish the creation of the organization.
6. In your shared editor, make a note of the URL of the organization's homepage.
7. Invite each of your team members to be an organization member.
8. Configure member privileges so that organization members can write to repositories. See __Settings__ >> __Member privileges__ >> __Repository permissions__ .

Congratulations! You have created an organization that can hold multiple repositories for your team. More importantly for this activity, this setup allows any of your team members to play the role of _maintainer_ or _contributor_ using a fork-pull-request based workflow (also known as [GitHub-flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow).

## Create a repository

__Assumptions__

* You are signed into GitHub.
* You have just created an organization.
* You are on your newly created organization's home page.
* Your organization is empty; i.e., it does not have any repositories.

__On GitHub__

1. Click the big green __Create a new repository__ button.
2. Name the repository `ourfavorites`.
3. Optionally add a description.
4. Make it public.
5. Initialize it with a README.
6. Optionally add a .gitignore (not necessary for this activity).
7. Add an open source license (unless you have a strong opinion, for now choose __GNU Public License v3.0__).
8. Click the big green __Create repository__ button
9. In your shared editor, make a note of the URL of the repository's homepage.

Congratulations! You have created your team's first repository.
