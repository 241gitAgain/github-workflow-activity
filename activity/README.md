# GitHub Workflow Activity

## Form teams of 2-3 persons

We suggest you work with someone who is uses the same operating system as you.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that each of your team members ...

    - [ ] Has git installed on their laptop.
    - [ ] Is logged into their GitHub account on their computer.

2. Create and share with your team a shared editor (e.g., Google docs, https://pad.riseup.net/, etc.) for notes.

3. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members and help them [Create an organization and a repository](create-an-organization-and-a-repository.md) for the team. Return here when you are done.

4. Assign the role of _contributor_ to one of your team members and help them [Prepare to contribute to a project](prepare-to-contribute-to-a-project.md). Return here when you are done.

5. If you were the _contributor_ in the previous step, help your other team members play the role of _contributor_ and complete the previous step. If you have a team of three, have the other two do this __in parallel__.

6. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members, and the role of _contributor_ to another. Help them follow the [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md) to create a new file `favorite-foods.txt` in the root of the project that contains a couple of their favorite foods. Maintainer, when asked to review the PR, accept and merge the PR.

7. Reassign the roles of _maintainer_ and _contributor_ to different team members. Help them follow the [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md) to add a couple of your favorite foods to `favorite-foods.txt`. ___BUT THIS TIME___
maintainer, when asked to review the PR, request an alteration (e.g., "no lettuce please"). Once the change is made, then accept and merge the PR.

8. This time, everyone is a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_. However, you cannot serve as a _maintainer_ for you own PR. Use the [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md) to complete the three tasks below at the same time. Note that if you use the issue tracker as described in the workflow, each task should be completed exactly once and by one person.
    * Add `favorite-movies.txt`
    * Add `favorite-books.txt`
    * (if you have three members) Add `favorite-sprots.txt`

9. Again, everyone plays the roles of a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_, but never serves as a _maintainer_ for their own PR. Use the [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md) to complete the three tasks below at the same time. Note that only the first PR to be merged should merge successfully the first time. The others should require resolving conflicts.
    * Sort the foods in `favorite-foods.txt` in ascending order.
    * After each food in `favorite-foods.txt` add one or more labels to categorize the food (e.g., `[vegetable]`, `[fruit]`, `[meat]`, etc.)
    * (if you have three members) Reformat the list of foods in `favorite-foods.txt` so that every item has a bullet in front (e.g., `*`). If they already have a bullet, change the bullet to a different style of bullet (e.g., `+` or `-`).
