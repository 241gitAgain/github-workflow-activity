## Time expectations

- 10-20 min:
  - ___Quickly___ review presentation.pptx with class
- 60-80 min:
  - Teams work through activity.md

## Form teams

Form a 2-3 person team. We suggest you work with someone who is uses the same operating system as you.

Before continuing ensure that ...

- [ ] Everyone in your team has a GitHub account.
- [ ] Everyone in your team is logged into their GitHub account.
- [ ] Everyone in your team has git installed on their laptop.

## Activity

1. Create and share with your team a shared editor (e.g., Google docs, https://pad.riseup.net/, etc.) for notes and answering questions.
2. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members and help them complete [Maintainer's Setup](). Return here when you are done.
3. Assign the role of _contributor_ to one of your team members and help them complete [Contributor's Setup](). Return here when you are done.
4. Assign the role of _contributor_ to all of your team members (even the one who was assigned the role of _maintainer_ before) and have them complete [Contributor's Setup](). If you were the contributor in the previous step, help your team to complete the setup. Return here when you are done.
5. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members, and the role of _contributor_ to another. Help them follow the [Workflow]() to create a new file `favorite-foods.txt` in the root of the project that contains a couple of their favorite foods. Maintainer, when asked to review the PR, accept and merge the PR.
6. Reassign the roles of _maintainer_ and _contributor_ to different team members. Help them follow the [Workflow]() to add a couple of your favorite foods to `favorite-foods.txt`. ___BUT THIS TIME___
maintainer, when asked to review the PR, request an alteration (e.g., "no lettuce please"). Once the change is made, then accept and merge the PR.
7. This time, everyone is a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_. However, you cannot serve as a _maintainer_ for you own PR. Use the [Workflow]() to complete the three tasks below at the same time. Note that if you use the issue tracker as described in the [Workflow](), each task should be completed exactly once and by one person.
    * Add `favorite-movies.txt`
    * Add `favorite-books.txt`
    * (if you have three members) Add `favorite-sprots.txt`
8. Again, everyone plays the roles of a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_, but never serves as a _maintainer_ for their own PR. Use the [Workflow]() to complete the three tasks below at the same time. Note that only the first PR to be merged should merge successfully the first time. The others should require resolving conflicts.
    * Sort the foods in `favorite-foods.txt` in ascending order.
    * After each food in `favorite-foods.txt` add one or more labels to categorize the food (e.g., `[vegetable]`, `[fruit]`, `[meat]`, etc.)
    * (if you have three members) Reformat the list of foods in `favorite-foods.txt` so that every item has a bullet in front (e.g., `*`). If they already have a bullet, change the bullet to a different style of bullet (e.g., `+` or `-`).
